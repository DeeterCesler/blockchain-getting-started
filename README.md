# blockchain-getting-started

This is a newbie's blockchain. Because everyone begins as a newbie.

The purpose of this is to demonstrate the basic principles of the chain, with a couple of API endpoints for mining and chain checking.

If you want to run this chain yourself, fork and clone the repo, edit the code if you want, and spin it up as a Flask server. Then hit the API (I used Postman) to create new blocks, and also to validate/invalidate the chain.

The chains do not persist if you shut your server down, as there is not database for this (because, you know, blockchain...or something). This is just for demo purposes.
